Sales Tax Problem
-----------------

* Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical products that are exempt. 
* Import duty is an additional sales tax applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions.
* Tax is calculated per product and is rounded to the nearest 5 cents.
* Invoice must lists the name of all the products and their price (including tax), finishing with the total cost of the items, and the total amounts of sales taxes paid.
